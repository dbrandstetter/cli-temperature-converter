# CLI RustðŸ¦€ Temperature Converter ðŸŒ¡
A lightweight cli rust application to convert Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin.

This project helped me successfully practice rust coding and the basic flow control, io and type concepts.

To run, just execute the complied file in <i>/target/release/cli-temperature-converter</i>
and enjoy the CLI experience.
